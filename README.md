Hey!

I'm a graduate in Computer Science, and love tinkering around with lil projects that I find interesting!

I like Machine Learning, Data Analytics & App Development, but here you'll mostly find stuff that I do to learn & create :) 

I have used C, C++, R, Python, html, js, and dabbled in Java.
